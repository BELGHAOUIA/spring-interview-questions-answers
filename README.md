## Spring Core

1. ### What is Spring Framework?

   Spring Framework is an open source application framework. We can also say that it is a lightweight inversion of control(IoC) container and aspect-oriented container framework for the Java platform. Spring handles the infrastructure so that we can focus on our application development. It was created by Rod Johnson. In 2003 Spring came into existence.

2. ### What is open source?

   Open source simply means the source code that anyone can see, inspect, modify, and enhance. If you want you can also contribute to [spring-framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework).

3. ### What is an application framework?

   An application framework is a software library that provides a fundamental structure to support the development of applications for a specific environment. An application framework acts as the skeletal support to build an application. The intention of designing application frameworks is to lessen the general issues faced during the development of applications.

4. ### How is Spring lightweight?

   Spring is considered lightweight compared to traditional Java EE applications. If we want to run a Java EE application, we can't just create a small application that will run on its own. We shall need a Java EE application server to run our application such as Glassfish, Wildfly, WebLogic, Websphere etc. Most application servers are big and complex pieces of software, that are not trivial to install or configure. Hence If we use Spring then we won't need such things.

   Secondly, Spring provides various modules for different purposes. These modules are grouped into Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, Messaging, and Test, as shown in the following diagram. To use one or part of the module we don't need to inject all the modules. For example, we can use Spring JDBC without Spring Web.

5. ### What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?

   Inversion of Control is a principle in Software Engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework.

   For example, say our application has a text editor component and we want to provide spell checking. Our standard code would look something like this:

   ```
   public class TextEditor {

     private SpellChecker checker = new SpellChecker();

   }
   ```

   Here TextEditor needs a SpellChecker object. Means TextEditor is dependent on SpellChecker and we are manually instantiating the TextEditor object. Means we are managing the dependency. Means we have the control. Now look at the below code:

   ```
   public class TextEditor {

    private SpellChecker checker;

    public TextEditor(SpellChecker checker) {
        this.checker = checker;
    }
   }
   ```

   Here we are asking the Spring to instantiate the SpellChecker object and pass in the constructor of TextEditor i.e. Constructor Injection. Means Spring is managing the dependency. Now the control is transferred from Programmer to Spring. This is nothing but Inversion of Control.

6. ### What is an aspect-oriented container framework?
 
   In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. In simple words we can say that it is a methodology which will separate cross-cutting concerns from core concerns. For example, if writing an application for handling medical records, the indexing of such records is a core concern, while logging a history of changes to the record database or user database, or an authentication system, would be cross-cutting concerns.
 
   **Core concern:** The logic that seems to be mandatory and without having that logic the existence of our application will not be there, such kind of logic is considered as core concern. Ex: writing business logic, fetching data from database/external API etc.
 
   **Cross-Cutting concern:** The program logic which is common across the application and the presence/absence of that logic does not impact core business functionality but if we apply the cross-cutting logic then it affects multiple points of an application is nothing but cross-cutting logic. Ex: Logging, Caching, Transaction processing, Security etc.
   
   ![cross-cutting-concerns](images/core/cross-cutting-concerns.png)
   
   The above figure represents a typical application that’s broken down into modules. Each module’s main concern is to provide services for its particular domain. But each module also requires similar ancillary functionalities, such as security, logging & transaction management.
   
   Spring has provided rich support for aspect-oriented programming in its AOP module. Hence we can say that Spring is an aspect-oriented container framework.
